                    <p>Welcome!</p>

                    <p>Our goal at Forex-Comix is to make language learning fun. We strongly believe that a student's progress can be accelerated when exposed to the diverse range of illustrated comics, books and graphic novels.</p>

                    <p>Given the public's appetite for superhero movies, the box office success of the Avengers and other movies, interest in comics has never been greater for both adults and children.</p>

                    <p>Our comic database is the ideal resource to complement your course material in a fun and challenging way.</p>
