                <p>Welcome!</p>

                <p>We love comics. We love language learning.</p>

                <p>We think foreign language comics are one of the best ways to achieve this aim.</p>

                <p>There is a surprisingly small number of foreign language comics in Dublin. For such a multicultural city, the options for language learners, especially for beginners, are typically children's books or novels which are often too advanced.</p>

                <p>We want to connect your comic books to an audience who will read widely and often.</p>
