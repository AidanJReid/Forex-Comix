# Forex Comix - The go-to resource for language learning for comic-book lovers

Forex-Comix: Foreign Exchange Comics. This website is a labour of love. It is designed for three types of users - but is underpinned by a love of learning languages and comic books/graphic novels.

It is my conviction that language learning can be fun, and with the abundance of comics readily available, they can introduce readers to various languages in a way that rote textbooks and stolid boring list tables cannot.

## UX

![Responsiveness Test]

From a language learner perspective, this site is relevant to all reading age groups.

1. **User story 1**: A language learner who wants to improve their proficiency in a specific language.
2. **User story 2**: A bookseller who wants to sell their comic books/raise awareness of their store (digital or physical).
3. **User story 3**: A language school/college that wishes to supply novel language comics to the classroom and curriculum to attract and engage students.
4. **User story 4**: Comic book fans in general who want to read widely.
5. **User story 5**: Comic book fans who want to meet likeminded people and or othersfrom different cultures/countries.

#### General

Regular testing was conducted throughout the course of this project, especially before commits to Github.

**Responsive/Mobile-first design** was tested using Chrome developer tools to ensure desired layout was achieved. As well as Chrome, I also used Safari (12.0) and Firefox (68.0.2) which collectively successfully affirmed my project's responsiveness.
To test responsiveness, the following mobiles were tested Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, iPhone 5/SE 6/7/8 Plus X, iPad and iPad Pro. All successfully passed in mobile responsiveness of the page.

Deployed using the Master Branch on hosting platform GitHub Pages. 

The following steps were taken:

  1. Create a `master` branch in Github repository 
  2. Use Local AWS Cloud9 environment to build the site
  3. Commit files to the staging area using bash terminal commands: `git status`; `git add (specify directory)`; `git commit -m "add message"`
  4. Push files to the working environment using `git push`, which updates the repository
  5. Publish site from `master` branch using `settings` tab in the main page of the repository, select `source` as `master branch`, then `save`
